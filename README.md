In this assignment, you will be implementing CS Paint, COMP1511's answer to the venerable drawing program. CS Paint is a program that allows us to draw images to our terminal using a series of commands. The commands are made up of integers and are typed directly into our program. Each command will make some change to a digital canvas, a space for drawing.

CS Paint is already capable of setting up and drawing its canvas, it will be up to you to write code so that it can read commands and make the correct changes in the canvas.
